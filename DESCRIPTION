Description: LinkrealTimeloads provides code to compute suspended-sediment load using RDI ADCP files, Eagle IO csv files, discharge, and cross-section surveys. Stephen Wallace provided crucial discussion and the functions in Import_Channelmaster_Data() that import data from RDI 000 files. Package code imports, processes, and computes suspended-sediment load using the CRAN package "realTimeloads". TSS is predicted from acoustic backscatter, turbidity, and time-period following Livsey et al (2023) at https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR033982 (see further discussion below). Package code is designed to allow WQI staff to setup directories for other sites and compute suspended-sediment loads using ADCP.
